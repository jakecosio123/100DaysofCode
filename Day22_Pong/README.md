There is currently a "bug" in the pong game:

When the ball hits the edge of a paddle it will 
bounce of and on the paddle multiple times before 
bouncing back at a much greater speed. 

I have adjusted the game ball speed to make this less 
devastating, but I am treating it as a "bug as a 
feature" at the moment as I do find that it adds a bit 
of strategy to the game and is fun. I do plan on 
eventually returning to fix it at some point in the future. 

I just wanted to document that I am aware and make a note
for myself to return eventually.
