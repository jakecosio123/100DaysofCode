All of the code for today is used to manipulate the bot in the Reeborg's World web app.

The day was primarily focused on learning how to use functions, the while loop, and indentation.

You can find Reeborg's World here to test the code or play around(if you'd like):

~~Note: There is currently a bug in the EscapeTheMaze.py file. If the robot starts in a few particular locations/orientations he can get stuck in a loop. I intend to fix this in the future (if I remember), but it was outside of the scope of today's challenge.~~

I couldn't sleep and thought of the solution while I was tossing and turning.
