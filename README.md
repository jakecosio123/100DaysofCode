In this repository you will find all of the code I wrote to complete the 100 Days of Code Challenge.

I am following the course by Dr. Angela Yu which can be found here:

Although the challenge is to do 100 days straight of 1 hour (or more) of coding per day, I intend to take off weekends to prioritize spending time with my family. In order to stay on track with the challenge though, I am still planning on completing 7 days of the course during each week. When I have extra time, I may try to do even more than 7 per week.
